  			<h3>
  				A- Creativity is the beginning
  			</h3>
  			<p>
  				For years I've created, written, and performed music for people all over the world. I started in my early teens discovering my creative side, first with music, then with paint and soon after, other outlets as well. Fastforward 3 years ago, this is when I became interested in computer code after watching a friend make a website from scratch. Seeing what could be done it almost seemed like magic, but no, it was just javascript.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				Since that time I have completed a number of online courses from websites like Team TreeHouse, Codecadmey, and FreeCoderCamp ranging from WordPress basics to Full Stack Javascript development. I have even recently completed a team project working with Coder Camps, a bootcamp style school for teaching how to develop using the MEAN stack.
